# ChromeGPT
A Chrome extension to send and receive messages with OpenAI's GPT. 
Download the zip file to access all the files. There should be a HTML popup, JavaScript popup, manifest file, and one image.
The extension currently works by asking users for their OpenAI API key. This is stored locally. Do not use if you are not comfortable with that.
Thanks for checking it out!
